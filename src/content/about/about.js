const intro = [
  <>The future is loud of noise, doubt, and excess.</>,
  <>But inside that chaos, we see a signal. A spark. A chance to rebuild what matters.</>,
  <>We are the founders of the Design Engineers Club—a collective of creators, technologists, and systems thinkers reclaiming control from mindless consumption. We build tools, spaces, and rituals for a future that serves people, not platforms.</>,
  <>We're actively crafting with clarity in a world that numbs and accelerates.</>,
  <>We move slow, but with purpose. Because when the old systems collapse, it won’t be the loudest that lead—it’ll be the most present, the most prepared.</>,
  <>We’re building that future now. Step by step. And you’re part of it.</>,
